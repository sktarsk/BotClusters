## ü™ß ***BotClusters***

Have you encountered the problem where you have to host less resource intense Telegram Bots for free and you can only host a bot for an account but you wanted to host all bots in one instance, well say no more...

You can run multiple bots in a same instance, for now it only works for pure python bots (no docker support yet) but you need to host this on services which provide Docker support.

## ‚ùìÔ∏è ***How to Use ?***

1. *Fork & Star this repository*
2. *Edit `config.json` to your Repo Data*
3. *Deploy and Host your Forked repository on server*
4. *Run Several Instance on Same Deploy*

## üî∞ ***Repo Features***

* **Stay Updated** since it clones from GitHub (on every Restart)
* **Extend** you can extend this to any number of bots by just adding more objects (see [Example](#example) below) although i recommend not to exceed 5 for 500 MB memory.
* **ENVs** you can set different ENV values for different bots even with same name.
* **Control** you can also set script file from where execution starts for that bot.
* **Private** you can also clone private repositories with help of Tokens. (see [Example](#example) below)
* **Web App** uses Flask to connect to service, so that it can be hosted as Dynamic Web Apps which is required for services like [Render](https://render.com/), [Koyeb](https://Koyeb.com/) etc.
